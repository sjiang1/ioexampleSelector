# AutoIoDocu
A documentation tool set that helps API developers create I/O examples and add the examples into API documents.
Our tool's name has changed due to legal reasons, but it is still the same tool referred to in our ICPC tool paper [1](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7961538/).
